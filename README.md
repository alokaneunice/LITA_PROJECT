## PROJECT TITLE: SALES PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS FOR A RETAIL STORE
### PROJECT OVERVIEW FOR SALES TRANSACTIONS
The sales performance of a retail store using the provided sales data will be analyzed. The goal is to uncover key insights, such as top-selling products, regional performance, and monthly sales trends, and to present these findings in an interactive Power Bl dashboard.The insights obtained will serve as pointers to the overall performance of the store.
### DATA SOURCE
The data used was provided by the Incubator Hub for LITA project. LITA is an acronym for LADIES IN TECH AFRICA, an initiative to empower women in the Technological ambience.
### TOOLS USED
- Microsoft Excel for data cleaning and analyses. [Download Here](www.microsoft.com)
- SQL for querying data
- Power BI for data visualizations
### EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
  1. Open the "LITA Capstone Dataset.xlsx" file in Excel.
     -  Highlight all the data, sort the data in descending or ascending order.
     - Using Conditional Formatting, check for the number of missing or blank cells within the specified range.
     - All duplicates were also removed from the tables.

  2. Create Pivot Tables to display:
     - Total Sales by Product: shows how much revenue was generated by each product.
     - Total Sales by Region: displays total sales for each region.
     - Monthly Sales Trends: illustrates sales trends over the months.
     - 
  ### CALCULATING KEY METRICS
  1. Average Sales per product: where Total Sales is calculated as "quantity*unitprice"
     ```
     =AVERAGEIF(C2:C50001, "Shirt", H2:H50001)
     =AVERAGEIF(C2:C50001, "Shoes", H2:H50001)
     ```
  2. Total Revenue by Region: where Revenue is calculated as "quantity*unitprice"
     ```
     =SUMIF(D2:D50001, "North", H2:H50001)
     =SUMIF(D2:D50001, "South", H2:H50001)
     ```
3. Query to retrieve the total sales for each product category
````
SELECT Product,  SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS TotalSales
FROM [dbo].[SalesData$]
GROUP BY [Product]
````
4. Query to find the number of sales transactions in each region
````
SELECT Region, COUNT(OrderID) AS NumberOfTransactions
FROM [dbo].[SalesData$]
GROUP BY Region
````
5. Query to find the highest-selling product by total sales value
````
SELECT Top 1 Product, SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS TotalSales
FROM [dbo].[SalesData$]
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC
````
6. Query to  calculate total revenue per product
````
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS TotalRevenue
FROM [dbo].[SalesData$]
GROUP BY Product
````
7. Query to calculate monthly sales totals for the current year
````
SELECT FORMAT(OrderDate, 'yyyy-MM') AS Month, SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS TotalSales
FROM [dbo].[SalesData$]
WHERE OrderDate >= DATEFROMPARTS(YEAR(GETDATE()), 1, 1) -- Start of the current year
  AND OrderDate < DATEADD(YEAR, 1, DATEFROMPARTS(YEAR(GETDATE()), 1, 1)) -- Start of the next year
GROUP BY FORMAT(OrderDate, 'yyyy-MM')
ORDER BY Month
````
8. Query to find the top 5 customers by total purchase amount
````
SELECT TOP 5 [Customer_Id], SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS TotalPurchase
FROM [dbo].[SalesData$]
GROUP BY [Customer_Id]
ORDER BY TotalPurchase DESC
````
9. Query to calculate the percentage of total sales contributed by each region-----
````
SELECT Region,
SUM (sales_Revenue) as total_sales,
ROUND ((SELECT SUM (sales_Revenue)/ CAST((SELECT SUM(sales_Revenue) 
FROM [dbo].[SalesData$] ) AS float) *100), 0) AS 
percentage_total_sales
FROM [dbo].[SalesData$]
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY Region DESC
````
10. Query to identify products with no sales in the last quarter
````
SELECT DISTINCT Product
FROM [dbo].[SalesData$]
WHERE Product NOT IN (
    SELECT Product
    FROM [dbo].[SalesData$]
    WHERE OrderDate >= DATEADD(MONTH, -3, GETDATE())
)
````
