## PROJECT TITLE: SALES PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS FOR A RETAIL STORE
### PROJECT OVERVIEW FOR SALES TRANSACTIONS
The sales performance of a retail store using the provided sales data will be analyzed. The goal is to uncover key insights, such as top-selling products, regional performance, and monthly sales trends, and to present these findings in an interactive Power Bl dashboard.The insights obtained will serve as pointers to the overall performance of the store.
### DATA SOURCE
The data used was provided by the Incubator Hub for LITA project. LITA is an acronym for LADIES IN TECH AFRICA, an initiative to empower women in the Technological ambience.
### TOOLS USED
- Microsoft Excel for data cleaning and analyses. [Download Here](www.microsoft.com)
- SQL for querying data
- Power BI for data visualizations
### EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
  1. Open the "LITA Capstone Dataset.xlsx" file in Excel.
     -  Highlight all the data, sort the data in descending or ascending order.
     - Using Conditional Formatting, check for the number of missing or blank cells within the specified range.
     - All duplicates were also removed from the tables.

  2. Create Pivot Tables to display:
     - Total Sales by Product: shows how much revenue was generated by each product.
     - Total Sales by Region: displays total sales for each region.
     - Monthly Sales Trends: illustrates sales trends over the months.
       
  ### CALCULATING KEY METRICS
  1. Average Sales per product: where Total Sales is calculated as "quantity*unitprice"
     ```
     =AVERAGEIF(C2:C50001, "Shirt", H2:H50001)
     =AVERAGEIF(C2:C50001, "Shoes", H2:H50001)
     ```
  2. Total Revenue by Region: where Revenue is calculated as "quantity*unitprice"
     ```
     =SUMIF(D2:D50001, "North", H2:H50001)
     =SUMIF(D2:D50001, "South", H2:H50001)
     ```
3. Query to retrieve the total sales for each product category
````
SELECT Product,  SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS TotalSales
FROM [dbo].[SalesData$]
GROUP BY [Product]
````
4. Query to find the number of sales transactions in each region
````
SELECT Region, COUNT(OrderID) AS NumberOfTransactions
FROM [dbo].[SalesData$]
GROUP BY Region
````
5. Query to find the highest-selling product by total sales value
````
SELECT Top 1 Product, SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS TotalSales
FROM [dbo].[SalesData$]
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC
````
6. Query to  calculate total revenue per product
````
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS TotalRevenue
FROM [dbo].[SalesData$]
GROUP BY Product
````
7. Query to calculate monthly sales totals for the current year
````
SELECT FORMAT(OrderDate, 'yyyy-MM') AS Month, SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS TotalSales
FROM [dbo].[SalesData$]
WHERE OrderDate >= DATEFROMPARTS(YEAR(GETDATE()), 1, 1) -- Start of the current year
  AND OrderDate < DATEADD(YEAR, 1, DATEFROMPARTS(YEAR(GETDATE()), 1, 1)) -- Start of the next year
GROUP BY FORMAT(OrderDate, 'yyyy-MM')
ORDER BY Month
````
8. Query to find the top 5 customers by total purchase amount
````
SELECT TOP 5 [Customer_Id], SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS TotalPurchase
FROM [dbo].[SalesData$]
GROUP BY [Customer_Id]
ORDER BY TotalPurchase DESC
````
9. Query to calculate the percentage of total sales contributed by each region-----
````
SELECT Region,
SUM (sales_Revenue) as total_sales,
ROUND ((SELECT SUM (sales_Revenue)/ CAST((SELECT SUM(sales_Revenue) 
FROM [dbo].[SalesData$] ) AS float) *100), 0) AS 
percentage_total_sales
FROM [dbo].[SalesData$]
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY Region DESC
````
10. Query to identify products with no sales in the last quarter
````
SELECT DISTINCT Product
FROM [dbo].[SalesData$]
WHERE Product NOT IN (
    SELECT Product
    FROM [dbo].[SalesData$]
    WHERE OrderDate >= DATEADD(MONTH, -3, GETDATE())
)
````

### INSIGHTS GENERATED
The Sales Data analysis tells a story of what customers love and how they shop. Shoes are the star of our sales, selling 14,402 units and becoming our best-selling product with a total revenue of 613,380. Meanwhile, socks, though popular, came in last with about 180,000 total revenue generated. Each month brought its own pattern, with February being the busiest month of all. As the year went on, the first and second quarters showed strong, high sales. But as summer turned into fall, sales began to drop, and by the fourth quarter, they were down by over 50%. Looking at different regions, the South led the way, making up 44% of our sales, followed by the East at 23%, the North at 18%, and finally, the West with 14%. Each area added its own flavor to our overall numbers, but together, they showed the store’s success across the region. One surprising insight was that higher-priced items usually sold better. Customers seemed to prefer spending a bit more when they felt the product’s quality was worth it. And, overall, the average sales rate was an impressive 211.78%, showing strong customer interest throughout the year.

### RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the sales data analysis provided, here are recommendations to enhance sales performance and customer satisfaction:

#### 1. *Focus on Best-Selling Products*
   - *Promote Shoes*: Since shoes are the top sellers, the store should consider launching targeted marketing campaigns, such as seasonal promotions or limited-edition releases, to further boost their sales.
   - *Cross-Selling with Socks*: Create bundled offers that include shoes and socks to increase the sales of the latter, potentially improving its sales ranking.

#### 2. *Seasonal Strategies*
   - *Capitalize on February*: Given that February is the busiest month, the store should plan major promotions or new product launches during this time to maximize traffic and sales.
   - *Address Seasonal Declines*: Develop a strategy to combat the drop in sales as fall approaches. This could include fall-themed promotions or introducing new products that align with seasonal trends.

#### 3. *Regional Marketing*
   - *Target the South*: With the South accounting for 44% of sales, invest in localized marketing efforts in this region, such as social media ads or community events, to further strengthen brand loyalty.
   - *Tailor Products to Regions*: Analyze regional preferences and introduce styles or products that cater specifically to the tastes of customers in the East, North, and West.

#### 4. *Quality Over Price*
   - *Highlight Quality*: Since higher-priced items are selling better, focus marketing efforts on the quality and craftsmanship of products. Use storytelling in advertising to convey value.
   - *Introduce New Premium Lines*: Consider developing a premium product line that emphasizes quality and exclusivity, appealing to the customers who prefer to spend more.

#### 5. *Improve Customer Engagement*
   - *Loyalty Programs*: Implement a customer loyalty program that rewards repeat purchases, especially for high-margin items. This could increase customer retention and average order value.
   - *Customer Feedback*: Actively seek customer feedback through surveys or social media to understand their preferences better and adjust product offerings accordingly.

#### 6. *Data-Driven Decisions*
   - *Continuous Analysis*: Regularly analyze sales data to track performance and identify trends. This will help in adjusting strategies in real-time and making informed decisions.
   - *Predictive Analytics*: Utilize predictive analytics to forecast demand for products based on historical data, helping to optimize inventory levels and reduce overstock.

#### 7. *Marketing and Advertising*
   - *Digital Marketing*: Increase investments in digital marketing channels, such as social media, SEO, and email campaigns, to reach a wider audience effectively.
   - *Influencer Collaborations*: Partner with influencers in the fashion and lifestyle sectors to promote your products and reach potential new customers.

By implementing these recommendations, the store can enhance its sales performance, improve customer satisfaction, and drive long-term growth.
